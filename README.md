**An Unofficial Flatpak Packaging of <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer">Firefox Developer Edition</a>.**


## ⚠️ Special Note
This is just an Flatpak packaging for the said software and does not include any licenses of its own. The `.desktop` file is written based on the original executable from the Firefox Release Channel (default). 
<br> **Usage of logo**: as per the [mozilla trademark policy](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/trademarks/policy/) : "use of Mozilla wordmarks in text to truthfully refer to and/or link to unmodified Mozilla programs, products, services and technologies" are considered as fare use.

## About The Application
This is a pre-beta release of Mozilla Firefox intended for Web developers and enthusiasts who want early access to new features. It receives new updates frequently, adding and refining support for the very latest Web standards that won't make it into the stable release of Firefox for some months. It also comes with some addons for Web development enabled by default.

You may find that Developer Edition works just fine for everyday use: Some users set it as their default Web browser. You can sign in to your normal Firefox account and sync your preferences, extensions, and bookmarks, etc. Or you can keep the Firefox versions separate, and use different profiles, even different browser UI themes. Firefox Developer Edition can install alongside the stable release of Firefox, making it easy to switch back and forth between the two versions.

That being said, a lot of the technology here is still experimental, and there will very likely be some bugs, so just remember that by using Developer Edition, you're helping Mozilla make Firefox the best Web browser they can. And have fun!
